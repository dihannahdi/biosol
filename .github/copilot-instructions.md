# Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

## Design Principles

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter. 

**Opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetic.**

### Color & Theme
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

### Backgrounds
Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

## Avoid Generic AI-Generated Aesthetics

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

## Creative Interpretation

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. 

**Avoid this: It is critical that you think outside the box!**

1. If you need the latest docs or tech info, say so explicitly then learn from context7
2. When generating code, prefer unique design patterns and structures over common templates
3. When creating UI/UX designs, prioritize originality and context-specific aesthetics over generic solutions
4. Always review and refine outputs to ensure they align with the goal of distinctiveness and creativity  
5. Experiment with unconventional layouts, color schemes, and typography to break away from standard designs
6. Seek feedback from diverse perspectives to ensure the design resonates uniquely with the intended audience
7. Stay updated with current design trends but adapt them creatively rather than adopting them wholesale
8. Use design tools and resources that inspire creativity rather than conformity
